I'm quite a big fan of [github][github], it really does rock.  I wonder if there's a clever way to sync files between [dropbox][dropbox] and [github][github]? 
For instance, I'd like to be able to write documents (perhaps in elements, plaintext or one of the other iOS text editors), syncing it through dropbox and then into github.  I'm enjoying the simplicity of this approach, although I can see how it might get in the way for a writer mainly concerned with getting thoughts down on paper.
